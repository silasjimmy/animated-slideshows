                Cyeco Limited, is a bicycle leasing company that started out as
                a passion project by the founders who are avid cyclists. With
                their zeal to preserve the environment through eco-friendly
                means of transport, they identified a niche in the market for
                providing carbon-free mode of transport at an affordable price.
                Together, the founders decided to start a business to fill the
                gap and like-minded folks to embrace the culture of cycling.

                        Cycling as a way to commute presents a plethora of
                        benefits which extend beyond mere transportation. Beyond
                        the financial savings garnered from bypassing fuel costs
                        and parking fees, cycling makes it easier to navigate
                        through urban landscapes effortlessly and evading
                        congested traffic, making it a convinient and flexible
                        mode of transport.

                      <p>
                        Embarking on cycling adventures allows exploration of
                        landscapes, from rugged terrains to serene countryside
                        trails, providing a unique perspective of the
                        surroundings. The freedom of movement on a bike enables
                        access to off-the-beaten-path locations unreachable by
                        conventional means, fostering a deeper connection with
                        nature and local communities. It cultivates a sense of
                        exploration and discovery, sparking curiosity while
                        uncovering hidden gems along the journey.

                        As a low-impact exercise, cycling is gentle on the
                        joints while providing an incredible full-body workout.
                        Engaging major muscle groups like the legs, glutes, and
                        core, cycling enhances strength, endurance, and muscle
                        tone. Its cardiovascular benefits are remarkable,
                        effectively boosting heart health and improving stamina.
                        Beyond physical benefits, cycling outdoors offers an
                        invigorating experience and fostering mental well-being
                        making it suitable for people of different ages fitness
